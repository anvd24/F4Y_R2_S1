{5010}{}{I didn't know about any plans. Please, tell me about them before you... Ahem.}

{6010}{}{Thanks. I'm listening.}
{7000}{}{Some time ago, on behalf of the Enclave, we ambushed a caravan heading to the Hub. They paid really good, gave us directions and told us to look for some technical documents.

{8010}{}{Come on, plans of what?}
{9000}{}{Easy, @sex@|man||darling|... I ain't no expert, but from what I managed to understand - it was 'bout some station on the sea... Yeah, I know that's hard to believe. It was called an "Oil Rig".}
{9010}{}{Where are they?}
{10000}{}{They're in my pocket. [Groans with pain.] Please, take them and deliver to the destination point. Coordinates are noted on the other side. [He turns pale.] It's a matter of honor.

{2000}{}{[Kaszle krwiï¿½.] Ugh... Kim jesteï¿½?}
{2010}{}{Nazywam siï¿½ @pname@. Nie wyglï¿½dasz zbyt dobrze, pomï¿½c ci jakoï¿½?}
{3000}{}{[Spluwa na podï¿½ogï¿½.] Nie moï¿½esz. Daj mi zdechï¿½ï¿½ w spokoju.}
{3010}{}{Co tu siï¿½ w ogï¿½le staï¿½o?}
{4000}{}{[Wskazuje palcem na trupa leï¿½ï¿½cego w kï¿½cie.] Ten koleï¿½... byï¿½ wtyczkï¿½ Enklawy. Skurwiel postrzeliï¿½ mnie, baï¿½ siï¿½ ï¿½e nie dotrzymam umowy i zatrzymam te plany przy sobie...}
{4010}{}{Plany? Jakie plany? }
{5000}{}{[Wyglï¿½da na zaskoczonego.] Myï¿½laï¿½em ï¿½e przysï¿½ali ciï¿½ ci drudzy, ï¿½eby je przejï¿½ï¿½...}
{5010}{}{Nikt mnie nie przysï¿½aï¿½ i nic nie wiem o ï¿½adnych planach... moï¿½esz mi to wyjaï¿½niï¿½? Zanim...}
{6000}{}{[Uï¿½miecha siï¿½.] Nie bojï¿½ siï¿½ ï¿½mierci, taki juï¿½ nasz los. ï¿½yjesz i umierasz, wielka mi sprawa. [Znowu kaszle krwiï¿½.] I tak nie mam tu z kim pogadaï¿½, wiï¿½c czemu nie...}
{6010}{}{Dziï¿½ki, zamieniam siï¿½ w sï¿½uch.}
{7000}{}{Jakiï¿½ czas temu Enklawa zleciï¿½a nam robotï¿½. Nic ciekawego, zwykï¿½a karawana do Hub. Jedyne co byï¿½o dziwne to zapï¿½ata, nikt nie pï¿½aci tak dobrze za takï¿½ robotï¿½... ale zaraz potem okazaï¿½o siï¿½ ï¿½e tak naprawdï¿½ chodzi im o dokumenty ktï¿½re miaï¿½ przy sobie jeden karzeï¿½. Szybko siï¿½ nimi zajï¿½liï¿½my, nie takie rzeczy siï¿½ robiï¿½o... [Smieje siï¿½ paskudnie.]}
{7010}{}{Jakie dokumenty?}
{8000}{}{[Chwyta siï¿½ za brzuch i wykrzywia.] Kurwa, gdybym nie byï¿½ tym, kim jestem, to bym powiedziaï¿½ ï¿½e zajebiï¿½cie boli... [Kaszle.] Ale dobra, o czym my tam? A, dokumenty. Plany. No, ten karzeï¿½ je miaï¿½. Zabronili nam na nie patrzeï¿½, ale wiesz jak to jest, taki zakaz to naprawdï¿½ zachï¿½ta... [Prï¿½buje siï¿½ ï¿½miaï¿½.]}
{8010}{}{Plany, plany czego?}
{9000}{}{Spokojnie, @sex@|stary||kotku|... Nie jestem fachowcem, ale z tego co wyglï¿½daï¿½o... wyglï¿½daï¿½o to jak jakaï¿½ instalacja na morzu... Na planach byï¿½o oznaczone jako "Platforma Wiertnicza".}
{9010}{}{I gdzie sï¿½ te plany?}
{10000}{}{Heheh, w mojej kieszeni. [Skrï¿½ca siï¿½ z bï¿½lu.] Masz, dostarcz je do punktu przeznaczenia. Wspï¿½rzï¿½dne masz podane na odwrocie. Albo jeszcze lepiej, skopiuj to sobie to tego ustrojstwa ktï¿½re masz na rï¿½ce... [Blednie.] To kwestia honoru, Najeï¿½dcy zawsze dotrzymujï¿½ swoich kontraktï¿½w. A jeï¿½li masz honor w dupie, jest jeszcze coï¿½. Powinni ci za nie dobrze zapï¿½aciï¿½, my dostaliï¿½my tylko czï¿½ï¿½ doli... Kurwa, chyba juï¿½ na mnie czas... Pamiï¿½taj... [Najeï¿½dca wydaje ostatnie tchnienie i umiera.]}
{10010}{}{[Odejdï¿½.]}
